//work in progress

This page is designed to serve as a repository for personal projects for building out cloud architecture (coming soon). 

I mainly intend it as a dumping ground for PoC cloud projects I hack together as a means of gaining hands-on experience with different technologies ... or really whatever I'm nerding out about that week.

Main areas of focus: GCP, serverless architecture, scalable architecture, Terraform and other IaC tools, infrastructure pipelines, AI/ML, etc.

I also plan to consolidate together excellent materials I find on these topics to serve as a reference for myself and others. Enjoy.
